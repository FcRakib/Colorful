## Installation

To get started with Colorful, you can use the Swift Package Manager. Add the following line to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/FcRakib/Colorful.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

```

After cloning, navigate to the Colorful directory and build the project:

swift build
```

## Usage

Using Colorful is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the color picker in your SwiftUI view:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Colorful

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selectedColor: Color = .red

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ColorPicker("Select a color", selection: $selectedColor)
                .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
                .padding()
            Text("Selected Color")
                .foregroundColor(selectedColor)
        }
    }
}
```

This code creates a basic color picker that allows users to select a color and see it reflected in a text label.

## Examples

Here are a few more examples to showcase the capabilities of Colorful:

### Example 1: Gradient Picker

```swift
struct GradientPickerView: View {
    @State private var startColor: Color = .blue
    @State private var endColor: Color = .green

    var body: some View {
        LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [startColor, endColor]), startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottom)
            .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
            .overlay(
                VStack {
                    ColorPicker("Start Color", selection: $startColor)
                    ColorPicker("End Color", selection: $endColor)
                }
            )
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Color History

You can also implement a color history feature to allow users to quickly access their recently used colors:

```swift
struct ColorHistoryView: View {
    @State private var colorHistory: [Color] = [.red, .green, .blue]

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ForEach(colorHistory, id: \.self) { color in
                Rectangle()
                    .fill(color)
                    .frame(height: 50)
                    .onTapGesture {
                        // Handle color selection
                    }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
